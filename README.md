# Movie Recommendation Application

This repository contains my attempt at creating a movie recommendation application for an assignment. The goal was to implement a system that takes user movie preferences and provides recommendations based on those preferences. The application was supposed to run on the Google Cloud platform.

## Overview
For this project, I attempted to create a backend using Flask and a frontend using Streamlit. The backend was designed to handle the recommendation system logic, while the frontend was meant to provide a user-friendly interface for inputting preferences and viewing recommendations.

## Components
### Backend:
Implemented with Flask.
Utilized Elasticsearch for movie title autocomplete.
Included methods to find similar users in the dataset and generate movie recommendations using BigQuery ML.
Dockerized and deployed on Cloud Run.
### Frontend:
Designed with Streamlit.
Planned to feature a movie title search bar and display recommended movie titles with their posters.
Unfortunately, could not complete integration with the backend due to difficulties.

## Challenges
This assignment proved to be significantly more challenging than the previous one. Despite attempting to follow the guidelines and utilizing resources like ChatGPT and seeking help from friends, I encountered several roadblocks:

### Difficulty with Streamlit:
I found it extremely challenging to integrate the Streamlit frontend with the Flask backend. Despite my efforts, I was unable to establish a functional connection between the two.

### Complexity of Dockerization:
Dockerization of the applications posed unexpected difficulties. Despite following tutorials and documentation, I encountered issues that I could not resolve.

### Understanding and Implementing Recommendation Logic:
While I attempted to follow the instructions for training a recommendation system and implementing similarity calculations, the complexity of the task made it hard for me to fully grasp and execute the required logic.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I regret to inform that I could not meet all the requirements of the assignment. Despite my efforts, I was unable to complete the integration between the Flask backend and the Streamlit frontend. Additionally, I encountered challenges with Dockerization and understanding the recommendation system logic.

I acknowledge that I may not have fully understood the complexity of the task, and I apologize for any shortcomings in my submission. I appreciate the opportunity to work on this assignment and will continue to strive for improvement in future projects
